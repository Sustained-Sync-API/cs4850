# üåç Sustainability Impact API

## Business Goal
How can we **amplify the overall impact of sustainability initiatives** by mapping and measuring how the outcomes of one effort influence and support other objectives?

## Project Idea
I propose building a **live Sustainability API** that leverages **machine learning** to analyze and correlate quantitative data from real-world sustainability efforts.  

The system would be trained on sustainability reports from large companies to uncover how one initiative (e.g., reducing water usage, optimizing energy, or supply chain changes) correlates with other, often unrecognized, impacts‚Äîboth positive and negative.  

**Example:**  
Consider a car wash business: using hot water may improve cleaning quality but increase environmental impact. The API could help predict the **optimal balance between quality and sustainability**, giving businesses actionable insights.  

## Core Features
- **Data Integration**  
  Companies could train their own version of the API using **PDF and Excel-based sustainability reports**.  

- **Machine Learning Insights**  
  Identify hidden **correlations between efforts and broader environmental or business impacts**.  

- **Versatile Output**  
  The API could power **dashboards, reports, and visualizations**, handling the heavy calculations behind the scenes.  

- **Ease of Use**  
  Designed to be accessible for **individual developers, organizations, and businesses** to integrate into their existing sustainability strategies.  

## Long-Term Vision
The system could eventually **connect with power providers** to get more accurate data insights‚Äîbased on the **specific energy sources** reflected in a business‚Äôs **power bill**.

‚úÖ This system would not only measure sustainability efforts but also show **how one action contributes to wider organizational goals**, enabling **smarter decisions with greater impact**.
